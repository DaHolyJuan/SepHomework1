I learned alot doing this homework, and figuring out what was repeatative and what able to be ommitted and consolidated.
Being able to make my code more legible and understandable, so anyone wanting to edit or look at my code would have ease of accessibility. 
Also, trying to learn to make more comments for myself and anyone looking at my code.
